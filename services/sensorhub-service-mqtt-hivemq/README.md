## MQTT Support based on HiveMQ

This module exposes common MQTT resources that can be used by other components (such as SensorThings or SensorWeb API). These resources are:

- Common MQTT API (for creating topics and connecting them to internal OSH queues)
- MQTT server
- MQTT client

The default MQTT server and client implementations provided by this module are based on HiveMQ.
